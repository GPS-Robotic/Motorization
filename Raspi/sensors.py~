# This modul shall start a background instance of advanced sensor-control
#
# After "import sensors" the module can be started by
#	mysensors = sensors.sensors()	<-- mode = 0, background thread not running yet (start=False)
#	or
#	mysensors = sensors.sensors(mode = mymode, start=mystart)
#		(both parameters are optional are only important for the background-thread)
#
# There are two possiblities to use the background-module:
#	1) single-measurements
#		via 
#			mysensors.get_sensor(sensor_number)
#		(sensor_number is 0, 1 or 2) one can take a single measurement of one sensor.
#		The result will be returned in a list, containing the result and the time of the measurement: [result, time],
#		where the result is by default in cm (can be adjusted).
#		Also the result will be saved in mysensors.measurements (see below)
#	
#		via 
#			mysensors.move_servo(value, percentage=-1)
#		one can move the servo of sensor 1
#		the parameter percentage is optional, by default it is -1.
#		If percentage is set, it MUST be between 0 and 1, defining the position: value = MIN + percentage*(MAX-MIN)
#		IMPORTANT: Nevertheless, also value must be set, but will be overwritten, if percentage is not -1!!!
#		If percentage is not set or set to -1, value will be the value to which the servo will be adjusted.
#		Currently the Null-Position is at 1500, MAX at 2000 and MIN at 1000. This is set in
#		mysensors.servo_MIN / _MAX / _NULL and can be adjusted
#		
#		even when background mode is running (start=True), one can make single-measurements.
#		ALWAYS the module is waiting for one measurement to be finished before starting another!! (To avoid interference)
#
#		NOTE: There are some constants, which are given back as result for invalid measurements. Check them to avoid errors!
#			(They may need to be adjusted, also get_sensor() may need to be adjusted....)
#
#	2) background-thread:
#		If start=True at initialization, the background-measurement-mode is started immediately.
#		The background-measurement can also be started afterwards by mysensors.start()
#		The background-thread will steadily measure values from the sensors and save the update as a list in mysensors.measurements,
#		the design of the list depends on the various settings and will be explained as follows...
#
#		At the moment it is possible to set one of three background modes, they are:
#			mode = 0:
#				the servo won't be moved, but can be adjusted by mysensors.move_servo(value) (see above)
#				the measurements will be done in the following cycle: 0-1-2-1-0-1-2-1-...,
#				meaning that sensor 0 will be called first, then sensor 1, then sensor 2, then sensor 1 again, ...
#				the measurements will be saved in mysensors.measurements as:
#					[[dist0, time0], [[dist1, time1]], [dist2, time2]]
#				(disti = distance, measured from sensor i; timei = time-stamp of that measurement...)
#				CAUTION: The entry for sensor1 ALWAYS is a double list!
#				         In this case, it is a list with only one entry. In the other cases there are more entries: 
#				         One for each border between the segments (=segments+1 entries), see below
#			mode = 1:
#				the measurement-cycle for the sensors is the same as at mode = 0:
#				the measurements will be done in the following cycle: 0-1-2-1-0-1-2-1-...,
#				meaning that sensor 0 will be called first, then sensor 1, then sensor 2, then sensor 1 again, ...
#				This time the sensor moves after each measurement of sensor 1, thus resulting in a scanning of the area
#				(roughly 180 degrees)
#				Therefore the servo-settings must have been done before (can be adjusted always also)
#				mysensors.servo_MIN / _MAX / _NULL define the valid range
#				mysensors.servo_segments define the number of segments
#				mysensors.servo_segment_size defines the size of each segment
#				mysensors.servo_segment_values defines the positions at which the measurements are done
#				CAUTION: to change these segment-settings, please use 
#						mysensors.update_segments(new_segment_size, new_segment_number=-1)
#					 where new_segment_number is optional.
#					 If new_segment_number is set to -1 or no set, new_segment_size defines the size of the new segments
#					 If new_segment_number is set, the new segment size will be (MAX - MIN) / new_segment_number,
#					 nevertheless, in this case ANY value for new_segment_size must be given as parameter, but isn't used.
#				IMPORTANT: to avoid errors: the following equation must hold!
#					servo_MAX - servo_MIN = servo_segments * servo_segment_size
#				servo_MAX / _MIN / _NULL & _OFFSET can be adjusted simply by reassignment....
#
#				NOTE: The number of measurements in this mode is equal to (servo_segment_number + 1),
#				      because the measurements are done BETWEEN the segments....
#
#				In mode = 1 the servo moves from left to right to left to right to left .....
#
#				mysensors.measurements will be designed as follows:
#					[[dist0, time0], [ [meas0, time1_0], [meas1, time1_1], [meas2, time1_2], ... ], [dist2, time2]]
#				where measi & time1_i are the result of the measurement of sensor 1 at position i and its time
#
#			mode = 2:
#				This is essentially the same as mode = 1 (see description above).
#				The only difference is, that the servo moves from left to right and then jumps back to left
#
#			Maybe there will be implemented further modes later on, see at def run(self) or in initilization-section for details...
#			to change the mode, use
#				mysensors.set_mode(new_mode)
#
# The PIN-Settings of the boar are saved in mysensors.ECHO & mysensors.TRIG & mysensors.SERVO (the first one are lists for sensors 0, 1 & 2)
# To change these settings and activate in a valid way, use
#	mysensors.set_PINS(TRIG=new_TRIG, ECHO=new_ECHO, SERVO=new_SERVO)
# each parameter is optional here, but the lists must be complete
#
# The pre-definition can be seen in the __init__ section
#
#
# For questions, write to PhilippGernandt@web.de
#
#
# NOTE: SOME ERRORS MIGHT STILL COME FROM mysensors.get_sensor()
# ESPECIALLY: SOME ABBORT-CRITERIA ARE DIFFICULT....
#
# NOTE: No-Echo-In-Result will be returned, but not saved,
#	Out-Of-Sight-Result will be returned & saved
#	Wrong-Sensor-Number-Error will be returned, but not saved
