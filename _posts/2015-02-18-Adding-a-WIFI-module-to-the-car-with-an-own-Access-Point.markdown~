So, 'till now we always had to connect the Raspberry Pi with a screen and keyboard to do some settings and scripting on it. This was especially annoying since the Raspi is located on our RC-car and we always had to put the hole car onto the table.
Therefore we finally managed to connect a WIFI-module with the Raspberry Pi and remote control it via SSH. As additional benefit we now are able to directly remote control the RC via SSH on the Raspi! Isn't that fun?!

Truely, it was a hard way to finally reach here. Just to tell you, why this was especially dificult:
First, we thought, we simply could plug some WLAN-module into the Raspi and connect to some network in order to be able to use SSH on another Laptop to control the Raspi remotely. Unfortunately our University is covered (only) by the Eduroam-Network, a www-accessible WIFI-Network. So this was the only candidate to connect with. So we did this only to find out, that there is no chance to connect to it via SSH from another computer: Port 22 is only opened for outgoing connections!
After




















Up to now we have not made any changes on the RC cars appearance, which is about to change. Of course it looks good as it is, but we need to introduce modifications, because we need more space! For the RasPi, the GPS module, sensors... we even plan on putting a small speaker on there.

But that is not all. We think part of the project is also artistic and we have in vision the 

# transparent car!

Besides making the chassis more lucent and permitting a view on the insides of it, we just designed the mounting plate for all the necessary components out of plexiglas.

Have a look on it:

## Working together

We also found out that it is quiet fun to work together as a team. Maybe one can get an impression of our working atmosphere from the following picture.

Last week Gero joint us and took the car out on the hallway for a test ride.
