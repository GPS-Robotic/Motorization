{"name":"Motorization","tagline":"Code for Raspberry Car Interface","body":"### Welcome to GPS-Robotic.\r\nThis page belongs to the advanced internship \"GPS on wheels\" of the Robotics lab Heidelberg at the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR). The aim of this internship is the construction of an autonomous model car controlled by an Raspberry Pi and guided by GPS data. The internship involves the construction of the hardware parts like the car, the steering via Raspberry as well as the development of appropriate algorithms.\r\n\r\n### Pictures\r\n![](https://github.com/GPS-Robotic/Motorization/blob/master/car.jpg)\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMax Hartmann\r\n\r\nPhilip Gernandt\r\n\r\nTobias Buck\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nGPS_Robotic@gmx.de","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
