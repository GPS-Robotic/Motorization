GPS on Wheels - A Robotics-Project at the IWR in Heidelberg
</h1>
<p class="fancy" align="justify">
This winter term we're doing an interesting internship at our university: We're constructing a robotic RC-car, supplied with a Rasperry Pi-Computer and a GPS-module in order to be able to drive autonomously. <br>
The internship started in October 2014 already and lasts until the end of March approximately.

The university
</h2>
<p class="fancy" align="justify">
The internship takes place at the <a href="http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/">University of Heidelberg</a>, located in a small, but famous and beautiful town in the south of Germany. The university can proudly call itself the oldest one in Germany.<br>
Altough all of us are studying physics, the project is part of the <a href="http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/">IWR (interdisciplinary research center for scientific computing)</a> at the <a href="http://www.mathinf.uni-heidelberg.de/">Informatics Faculty</a>, which illustrates the flexibility in our studies and also gives a hint of what we're mainly doing here: programming.<br>
As we are not the only ones working in a robotic internship, here is a <a href="http://joanna.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/rlab/en/projects_list+sid=21">list of all current robotic-projects</a> at the <a href="http://joanna.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/rlab/en/home">Robotics Lab</a>.

The goals
</h2>
<p class="fancy" align="justify">
The main goal is to construct and configure an autonomous RC-car, which should be able to reach a given GPS-Position somewhere nearby, avoiding small obstacles.<br>
Thus it is part of the project to supply a RC-car with a small computer (Raspberry-Pi), a GPS-module and some sensors to detect obstacles. Of course, also the programming of the components -as they need to work together- makes a great part of it.<br>
Some milestones can be summarized as follows:

<ul>
<li> choosing appropriate components (RC-car construction-kit, batteries, motor, Raspberry Pi, ultra-sonic sensors, GPS-module, servos ...)
<li> constructing the RC-car out of the construction-kit, attach batteries, motor & cruise control
<li> modifying the car by attaching the Raspberry Pi, as well as the sensors & the GPS-module;<br>herefore: adding a platform onto which the components can be put
<li> connecting all components in a safe way
<li> constructing some cover for the electronics to be safe from dirt, moisture etc.
<li> developing some algorithm of how everything works together
<li> programming a lot of routines for the different needs (getting GPS-position, calculating target-position & direction, getting sensor-data, recognizing obstacles, driving the car, avoiding obstacles, finding a good way, handling errors...)
<li> testing, impoving, testing, improving....
</ul>

<br>
Besides these practicle things, of course it is a declared goal to improve our skills and to learn about informatics during this internship. Apart from programming (mainly python here), the project also involves a lot of (electronical) handicraft. We therefore get in touch with electric circuits, information processing, mechanics and the interplay of hard- and software.

<br>
<br>

As we will have to face many problems, we will have to learn to react and find solutions flexibly.

The resources & components
</h2>
<p class="fancy" align="justify">
Except our knowledge, the ressources we are using are either provided by the informatics faculty (thanks, guys ;) ) or are open-source (source-code & information from the internet).<br>
As there are <a href="http://joanna.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/rlab/en/projects_list+sid=21">many other groups</a> working on different robotic-projects at the IWR, there is a small room available to all internship-students at the university, equipped with computers, internet and a lot of hardware-stuff (cables, connectors, electronic components, wood, metal, screws, ...). Also any tools needed, such as screw-drivers, drilling machines, saws, soldering irons, voltage and ampere meters, voltage suppliers and many more things, can be found and used there.<br>
<br>
Besides some cables, switches, diodes, connectors, screws and plexiglas, the components we are using, are
<ul>
<li> a RC-car construction-kit <a href="http://www.conrad.de/ce/de/product/236747/Reely-Blaze-110-RC-Modellauto-Elektro-Truggy-4WD-Bausatz?ref=searchDetail" target="_blank">"Reely Blaze"</a> from <a href="http://www.conrad.de">Conrad Electronics</a> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/project/components/reely_kit.jpg">image1</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/project/components/reely_blaze.jpg">image2</a>)
<li> a 7.2V 7700mAh NiMh <a href="http://www.conrad.de/ce/de/product/206030/Modellbau-Akkupack-NiMh-72-V-3700-mAh-Conrad-energy-Stick-Tamiya-Stecker?ref=searchDetail">rechargeable battery pack</a> for RC-cars from <a href="www.conrad.de">Conrad Electronics</a> for the motor and peripheral devices (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/project/components/battery_pack.jpg">image</a>)
<li> a V mAh NiMh <a href="">rechargeable battery pack</a> from <a href="www.conrad.de">Conrad Electronics</a> only for the Raspberry's power supply
<li> a cruise control (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/project/components/cruise_control.jpg">image</a>)
<li> a motor (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/project/components/motor1.jpg">image1</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/project/components/motor2.jpg">image2</a>)
