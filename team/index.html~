<p class="fancy"> Hi, </p>

<p class="fancy"> 
except tinkering with some LEDs, I had not much experience with electronics before the internship. Because I really like doing <a href="http://www.instructables.com/">handicraft work</a> I thought this project would be perfect to learn a lot and have fun doing it. The prospect of finally programming something that will actually move is also a major motivation in contrast to the simulations I run for my Master thesis.
</p>

<p class="fancy">
For my thesis I work at the MPI for nuclear physics in the <a href="http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/mpi/pfeifer/interatto-group/">division quantum dynamics and control</a>. In our group we do time-resolved spectroscopy in the femtosecond domain. My job has to do with the characterization of the pulses in the time domain.
</p>

<p class="fancy">
During my freetime I like reading fantasy books, <a href="http://www.chilloutzone.net/">watching stupid videos</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">movie trailers</a> and spending time with my girlfriend. YES, exactly in this order :)
