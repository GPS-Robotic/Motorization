Hi there!
<br><br>
like my colleagues I'm doing my master-studies in pyhisics, though I didn't start my master-thesis yet. Up to now my main-domain is theoretical particle-physics, in which I did my bachelor-thesis. Also programming and simulating is a big part of my daily routine.
<br><br>
Concerning handicraft my skills are good, but not fully elaborated yet. This is one of the reasons for me doing this internship. Also I like puzzeling around with code and keeping improving it until it works out as I want to. Seeing the result is amazing!
<br>
The main reason, however, is, that constructing an autonomous RC-car is a whole lot of... FUN!
<br><br>
My free time I'm spendig doing sports like running, Capoeira or climbing, as well as relaxing with friends, family or my girlfriend. ;)
