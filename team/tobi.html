	Hi, my name is Tobias,
	and like my companions I study physics and currently write my master thesis. I like building fancy stuff (pictures see below) and work with every kind of technical things. Before this project I build an <a href="http://joanna.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/projects/XYLOPHON/A/Startseite.html">Xylophon robot</a> also in the robotic lab of IWR. My other experiences with electronic devices are a LED cube with 8x8x8 LED, a selfmade beamer from an overhead projector and LCD panel as well as some minor LED things.

I work at the MPI for Astronomy in the Galaxy departement in the <a href="http://www.mpia.de/~maccio/GFG/home.html">Galaxy formation group</a> of Andrea V. Nacci√≤. In our group we run simulations on galaxy formation. For my master thesis I run high resolution simulation on the Andromeda galaxy to analyses the assembly of substructure around it.

In my freetime I like playing flute, reading books or meet my friends. And if there is time left, I like as indicated above building fancy things like these:

or many other more, depending on time, material, money and ideas.
